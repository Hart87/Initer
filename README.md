A very quick idea I ran with to initialize a handful of files
nobody thinks about while starting a project. Add to it how you
feel. I have bigger plans for this as well.

HOW TO USE :
  Copy the init.sh file into your new projects directory
  in the terminal : chmod a+rx init.sh
  again in the terminal : ./init.sh

  Your directory should be populated with files.
